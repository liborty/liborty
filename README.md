- 👋 Hi, I’m an 'old timer' programmer, living in 🇦🇺. I am interested in Maths, Data Analysis, Encryption, Trading Apps, E-democracy, ... 
- :book: Here is my book: 🔖 [Bash for Fun](https://leanpub.com/bashforfun) :bookmark:. Should you wish to support me, just buy the e-book online and enjoy, thank you! It explains Bash and also relates to my Bash+Rust compressing/encrypting/archiving app here: [TokenCrypt](https://github.com/liborty/TokenCrypt)
- ⌛ Some of my interests are reflected in the repositories here, written variously in: Rust, Bash, Javascript, and C.
